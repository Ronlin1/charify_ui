# Charify Crowdfunding Platform - Prototype Overview

## Project Overview
Charify is an innovative crowdfunding platform designed to empower communities and individuals to launch and support fundraising campaigns seamlessly. Our goal is to facilitate transparent and user-friendly experiences for campaign creators and donors alike. This repository includes both low-fidelity (Lo-Fi) and high-fidelity (Hi-Fi) prototypes created using Figma, showcasing the core user flow and interactions of the Charify platform.

## Prototype Details
We designed six primary screens to capture the essential user interactions on Charify:

1. **Splash Screen**: 
   - **Purpose**: The initial loading screen that introduces the platform’s branding and sets the tone for the app experience.
   - **Design Elements**: Display of the Charify logo and a brief animation to engage users.

2. **Welcome Screen**:
   - **Purpose**: Greets users with a brief introduction and provides options to proceed to login or sign up.
   - **Design Elements**: Minimalist design with clear call-to-action buttons ("Log In" and "Sign Up").

3. **Login Screen**:
   - **Purpose**: Allows returning users to log in to their accounts.
   - **Design Elements**: Form fields for email/username and password with a “Forgot Password?” link and a “Login” button.

4. **Signup Screen**:
   - **Purpose**: Enables new users to create an account.
   - **Design Elements**: Simple registration form with input fields for name, email, and password, along with a “Sign Up” button and terms of service acknowledgment.

5. **Campaigns Screen**:
   - **Purpose**: Displays an overview of ongoing campaigns that users can browse and select to learn more.
   - **Design Elements**: Campaign cards showcasing titles, images, and progress bars indicating the amount raised.

6. **Donations Screen**:
   - **Purpose**: Facilitates the process for users to contribute to a chosen campaign.
   - **Design Elements**: Details of the selected campaign, a donation input field, and a “Donate Now” button.

## Design Stages
### 1. Low-Fidelity (Lo-Fi) Prototypes
- **Objective**: Focus on basic layout, structure, and user flow without detailed design elements.
- **Tools Used**: Figma's basic shapes and text labels.
- **Outcome**: Quick visualization of how screens and interactions are organized, allowing for early-stage feedback and iterative changes.

### 2. High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) Prototypes
- **Objective**: Refine the user experience by incorporating final design elements such as color schemes, typography, images, and interactive components.
- **Tools Used**: Figma with detailed design assets and components.
- **Outcome**: A realistic representation of the final product, showcasing the full user experience with visually appealing elements and micro-interactions.
